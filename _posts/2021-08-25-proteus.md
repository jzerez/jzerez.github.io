title: Proteus-Amazon's first fully autonomous mobile robot 
excerpt: Since getting my Bachelor's Degree, I've been a mechanical engineer at Amazon Robotics, developing hardware components from concept to mass-production for Amazon's first fully autonomous and safety certified mobile robot. I've also spent time developing computational tools to support sensor module testing, characterization, and optimization.
