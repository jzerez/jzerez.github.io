title: FSAE Anti Roll Bar
excerpt: I developed a set of MATLAB scripts to determine the specific geometries for the Anti-Roll Bars for the 2018-2019 Olin Electric Motorsports Racecar (FSAE). After high level design/analysis was done, I did mechanical design and integration in Solidworks. Finally, I fabricated them, and tested them for validation before assembly onto the car.
