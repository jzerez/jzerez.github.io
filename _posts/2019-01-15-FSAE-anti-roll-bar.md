title: FSAE Anti Roll Bar
excerpt: I developed a set of MATLAB scripts to determine the specific geometries for the Anti-Roll Bars for the 2018-2019 Olin Electric Motorsports Racecar (FSAE). After high level design/analysis was done, I did mechanical design and integration in Solidworks. Finally, I fabricated them, and tested them for validation before assembly onto the car.

## Introduction
An anti-roll bar, also known as an anti-sway bar, is a linkage that is used in vehicle suspensions that increases the roll stiffness of the suspension independently of the ride stiffness. By uncoupling the roll stiffness and ride stiffness of the suspension, it allows for more flexible suspension characteristics. If properly designed, an anti-roll bar can also be used to tune the roll stiffness of the vehicle to match the track or the preferences of the driver.

The anti-roll bar that I designed had a geometry that integrated well with the rest of the chassis and exsisting suspension system. All chassis mounting points were close to nodes of the chassis to minimize local deflection, and the various linkages in the system were positioned to reduce bending moments and to result in desirable and consistent motion ratios. The anti-roll bar is based around an aluminum tube that is used as a torsional spring that connects the left suspension with the right suspension.
