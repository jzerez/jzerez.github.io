title: FSAE Suspension And Chassis
excerpt: I worked with two other team mates to design and fabricate the suspension and chassis for the 2018-2019 Olin Electric Motorsports Racecar (FSAE). We started from the ground up, first reading essential chapters from Race Car Vehicle Dynamics by Milliken and Milliken. We built a series of MATLAB scripts and simulations to help to design aspects of the suspension to best meet requirements.
