title: Inverted Pendulum PID
excerpt: A partner and I created and tuned a PID controller to effectively maneuver a segway-like inverted pendulum robot. We tuned the PID analytically by viewing the transfer function of the system in the s-domain.
short_desc: Implemented a PID controller to keep segway-like robot standing
