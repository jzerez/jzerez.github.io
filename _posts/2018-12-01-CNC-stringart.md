title: CNC Stringart
excerpt: I worked on a team with four others to create a 2 axis CNC string art machine. I designed the entire mechanical system from the ground up, ensuring the design was modular, quick to assemble, easy to fabricate, and would provide us with a reliable platform to test with. I also did some development work on the path planning algorithm.
