title: Neato Slam
excerpt: A partner and I wrote a SLAM algorithm for a robotic vacuum cleaner with a 2-D LIDAR sensor. I implemented point clustering and feature extraction routines to perform on the LIDAR point clouds. I also implemented the Iterative Closest Points algorithm paired with a Bayesian correspondence detector to stitch scans from subsequent steps together.
