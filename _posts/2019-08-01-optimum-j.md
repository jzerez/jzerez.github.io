title: Optimum J
excerpt: In this project, I created a MATLAB tool that automatically generates suspension designs that best embody specified characteristics while conforming to imposed packaging constraints. It implements a forward kinematic simulation of a suspension system to calculate the motion profile and associated characteristics of a suspension design, and uses that to slowly optimize the suspension to match specified characteristics. It was used to design the suspension system in the 2019-2020 Olin Electric Motorsports Vehicle (FSAE).
