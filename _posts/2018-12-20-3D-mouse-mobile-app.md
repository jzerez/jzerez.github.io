title: 3D Mouse Mobile App
excerpt: A partner and I created an android mobile app that interfaced with Solidworks running on a PC. It allowed the user to rotate the Solidworks model by rotating the phone, and also allowed for dynamic shortcut inputs from the phone depending on the current active Solidworks activity.
short_desc: A project that turns a phone into a 3D mouse for Solidworks!
