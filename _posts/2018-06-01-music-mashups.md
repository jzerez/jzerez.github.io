title: Music Mashups
excerpt: I used python to read and analyze the wave-forms of various songs in order to try to find their tempos. It then combines the lyrics of one song to the instrumentals to make a mashup! Most of the lyrics are from popular rap songs, and most of the instrumentals are from Ratatat, one of my favorite artists.
